    "There are three ways to build a recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Popularity based recommendation engine\n",
    "2. Content based recommendation engine\n",
    "3. Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets discuss the difference between these three:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popularity based recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest kind of recommendation engine that we will come across. The trending list we see in YouTube or Netflix is based on this algorithm. It keeps a track of view counts for each movie/video and then lists movies based on views in descending order. Very simple, yet effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content based recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (storyline, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative filtering based recommendation engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm at first tries to find similar users based on their activities and preferences (for example, both the users watch same type of movies or movies directed by the same director). Now, between these users(A and B) if user A has seen a movie that user B has not seen yet, then that movie gets recommended to user B and vice-versa. In other words, the recommendations get filtered based on the collaboration between similar user’s preferences (thus, the name “Collaborative Filtering”).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another type of recommendation system can be created by mixing properties of two or more types of recommendation systems. This type of recommendation systems are known as hybrid recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to implement a Content based recommendation system using the scikit-learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding the similarity we'll be using Cosine similarity. We will represent texts as vectors using `CountVectorizer()` class from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` library and then check the similarity using `cosine_similarity()` function from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` library."
